# ERA-SESSION18 UNET & VAE Implementation in PyTorch Lightning


### Tasks:
1. :heavy_check_mark: Train your own UNet from scratch, you can use the dataset and strategy provided in this linkLinks to an external site.. However, you need to train it 4 times:
  - :heavy_check_mark: MP+Tr+BCE
  - :heavy_check_mark: MP+Tr+Dice Loss
  - :heavy_check_mark: StrConv+Tr+BCE
  - :heavy_check_mark: StrConv+Ups+Dice Loss
2. :heavy_check_mark: Design a variation of a VAE that:
  - :heavy_check_mark: takes in two inputs: an MNIST image, and its label (one hot encoded vector sent through an embedding layer)
  - :heavy_check_mark: Training as you would train a VAE
  - :heavy_check_mark: Now randomly send an MNIST image, but with a wrong label. Do this 25 times, and share what the VAE makes (25 images stacked in 1 image)!
  - :heavy_check_mark: Now do this for CIFAR10 and share 25 images (1 stacked image)!
  - :heavy_check_mark: Questions asked in the assignment are:
    - :heavy_check_mark: Share the MNIST notebook link ON GITHUB [100]
    - :heavy_check_mark: Share the CIFAR notebook link ON GITHUB [200]
    - :heavy_check_mark: Upload the 25 MNIST outputs PROPERLY labeled [250]
    - :heavy_check_mark: Upload the 25 CIFAR outputs PROPERLY labeled. [450]
